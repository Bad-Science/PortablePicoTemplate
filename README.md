# Minimal RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico) Portable C Template

## Initial Setup
Run this first to generate the build files
```
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```
All build files are ignored by the included .gitignore, so you will want to run
the above whenever you clone your repo.

## Building
To build the project, simply run
```
$ make
```
from within the `build` directory
